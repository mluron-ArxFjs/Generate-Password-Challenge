# Generate-Password-Challenge
## Description
Randomly generated passwords can provide greater security for sensitive data. HTML is used to markup the structure, CSS to style the Password Generator Dialogue content, and JavaScript to program the logical behavior to generate a random password after gathering user inputs through a series of prompts and alerts. Specific criteria for the password include:
// WHEN I click the button to generate a password
// THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
// WHEN prompted for password criteria
// THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
// WHEN prompted for the length of the password
// THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
// WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
// THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
// WHEN I answer each prompt
// THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
// WHEN all prompts are answered
// THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
// WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.

## Usage
1. Open the password generator URL.
2. Generate a random password by clicking the "Generate Password" button and following the prompts and alerts.
